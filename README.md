Econometric Models for Quantitative Finance

This repository showcases my alpha research using time series econometrics. The first folder contains four core models: ARIMA for price forecasting, GARCH for volatility signals, VECM for cointegration-based pairs trading, and VAR for multi-asset strategies. These form the foundation of systematic signal generation.

The second folder implements Markov Switching versions of these same models, capturing regime-dependent alphas across bull/bear markets and volatility regimes. This approach allows for adaptive strategies that respond to structural breaks and changing market conditions, essential for robust quantitative trading systems.
